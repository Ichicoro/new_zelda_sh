# Showing password asterisks as feedback in sudo

A friend showed me a very useful feature he had enabled in sudo, which let him see a masked (with asterisks) view of the typed characters in the password prompt. Here's how to enable it! <Star className="inline ml-0 w-3 h-4" />

Open your terminal and edit your sudoers file with `visudo`:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

> ### <Star className="inline ml-0 w-3 h-4" /> Side note!

> ```bash
> EDITOR=micro sudo visudo
> ```

Modify the following line
```
Defaults env_reset
```
with
```
Defaults env_reset,pwfeedback
```
